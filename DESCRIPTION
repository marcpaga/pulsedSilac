Description: This package provides several tools for pulsed-SILAC data analysis.
    Functions are provided to organize the data, calculate isotope ratios, 
    isotope fractions, model protein turnover, compare turnover models, estimate 
    cell growth and estimate isotope recycling. Several visualization tools are
    also included to do basic data exploration, quality control, condition 
    comparison, individual model inspection and model comparison.
